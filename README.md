Introduction to LaTeX
=====================

What is it?
-----------

These are the LaTeX source files for a presentation about LaTeX. The presentation discusses the pros/cons of LaTeX compared to word processors, showcases the possible uses of LaTeX and finishes with a brief discussion of typography. It was used as an introductiory lecture for second year students of mathematics at Brunel University London in 2017.

[Compiled PDF files](http://www.brunel.ac.uk/~mastmmb/latex.html) are available on my website.

Dependencies
------------

The presentation can be compiled with `pdflatex` provided all the necessary packages are installed.
